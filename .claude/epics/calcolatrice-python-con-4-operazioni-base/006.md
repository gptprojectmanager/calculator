# Task 006: Documentation and Quality Assurance

**Epic:** calcolatrice-python-con-4-operazioni-base
**Created:** 2025-09-22T19:02:04Z
**Effort:** S (4h)
**Parallel:** false
**Dependencies:** [004, 005]

## Description

Finalize the project with comprehensive documentation, code quality checks, and performance validation. Create user documentation, ensure code standards compliance, and validate the complete calculator implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions and classes following Python documentation standards
2. Create README.md with installation instructions, usage examples, and feature overview
3. Run code linting with flake8/pylint and fix all style issues to maintain consistent code quality
4. Implement type checking with mypy and add type hints throughout the codebase
5. Perform performance validation and optimization for large number calculations

## Technical Notes

- Follow PEP 257 for docstring conventions
- Include code examples in README with expected outputs
- Configure linting tools with appropriate rules for the project
- Add type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Test performance with large numbers and document any limitations
- Ensure all dependencies are documented in requirements.txt

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings added to all code
- [ ] README.md created with usage examples
- [ ] Code linting completed with zero violations
- [ ] Type checking implemented with mypy
- [ ] Performance validation completed
