# Task 004: Create Comprehensive Test Suite

**Epic:** calcolatrice-python-con-4-operazioni-base
**Created:** 2025-09-22T19:02:04Z
**Effort:** M (8h)
**Parallel:** true
**Dependencies:** [003]

## Description

Develop a comprehensive test suite covering all arithmetic operations, error conditions, and edge cases. Implement unit tests with high coverage and verbose output for debugging. Follow TDD principles with meaningful test cases that reveal potential flaws.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Write unit tests for all four arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with multiple test cases each
2. Test all error conditions including division by zero, invalid types, and None values with proper exception verification
3. Implement edge case testing for large numbers, negative numbers, zero, and floating-point precision
4. Achieve 95%+ test coverage with coverage reporting and ensure all code paths are tested
5. Create verbose test output with descriptive test names and failure messages for effective debugging

## Technical Notes

- Use pytest framework with proper test organization and fixtures
- Implement parametrized tests for multiple input combinations
- Test both successful operations and exception scenarios
- Include performance tests for large number calculations
- Follow naming convention: test_operation_condition_expected_result
- Use coverage.py for coverage measurement and reporting

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Unit tests implemented for all arithmetic operations
- [ ] Error condition tests with proper exception verification
- [ ] Edge case tests for boundary conditions
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage achieved and verified
- [ ] Verbose test output with clear debugging information
