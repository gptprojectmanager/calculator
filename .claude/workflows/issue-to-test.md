# Issue-to-Test Workflow

Streamlined workflow for converting GitHub Issues directly into comprehensive test suites using TDD methodology.

## Overview
Rapid conversion of GitHub Issues (bugs, features, enhancements) into test-driven implementation plans.

## Use Cases
- Bug reproduction and fixing
- Feature implementation from user stories
- Enhancement requests with specific requirements
- Technical debt resolution with validation

## Quick Start
```
/pm:issue-start [issue-number]
/tdd:spec-to-test
/tdd:cycle
```

## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis
```
/pm:issue-start [issue-number]
```
**Actions:**
- Load GitHub Issue content
- Parse description and acceptance criteria
- Identify stakeholders and context
- Extract testable requirements

**Outputs:**
- Requirement summary
- Acceptance criteria list
- Testing scope definition

### Phase 2: Test Planning
```
/tdd:spec-to-test
```
**Actions:**
- Generate test scenarios from issue description
- Create test cases for acceptance criteria
- Design error condition tests
- Plan integration test coverage

**Outputs:**
- Comprehensive test suite
- Test file structure
- Coverage planning document

### Phase 3: Implementation Cycle
```
/tdd:cycle
```
**Actions:**
- Execute complete Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Ensure all tests represent issue requirements
- Implement solution incrementally
- Maintain quality throughout process

**Outputs:**
- Working implementation
- Passing test suite
- Quality-assured code

### Phase 4: Validation and Closure
```
/pm:issue-close [issue-number]
```
**Actions:**
- Validate all acceptance criteria met
- Confirm test coverage requirements
- Update issue with completion details
- Link implementation to original requirements

**Outputs:**
- Closed GitHub Issue
- Traceability documentation
- Test coverage report

## Issue Type Adaptations

### Bug Reports
1. **Reproduction Tests**: Create tests that reproduce the bug
2. **Fix Validation**: Ensure fix resolves the issue
3. **Regression Prevention**: Add tests to prevent recurrence
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test similar scenarios

### Feature Requests
1. **User Story Tests**: Convert user stories to test scenarios
2. **Acceptance Tests**: Validate all acceptance criteria
3. **Integration Tests**: Ensure feature integrates properly
4. **Performance Tests**: Validate performance requirements

### Enhancement Requests
1. **Current State Tests**: Document existing behavior
2. **Enhanced Behavior Tests**: Define improved functionality
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing features remain
4. **Migration Tests**: Validate upgrade paths

### Technical Debt
1. **Current Behavior Tests**: Document existing functionality
2. **Refactoring Tests**: Ensure behavior preservation
3. **Quality Improvement Tests**: Validate improvements
4. **Performance Tests**: Measure optimization benefits
