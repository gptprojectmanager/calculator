# Specification to Test Command

Convert specifications and requirements into comprehensive test suites.

## Command
`/tdd:spec-to-test`

## Description
Analyzes project specifications, PRDs, and issue requirements to generate comprehensive test cases that validate all expected behaviors.

## Integration with CCPM
- Reads specifications from `/pm:issue-start` context
- Analyzes PRD documents from `.claude/prds/`
- Converts Epic requirements into test scenarios
- Links tests to GitHub Issues for traceability

## Process
1. Load current issue/specification context
2. Parse requirements and acceptance criteria
3. Identify all testable behaviors
4. Generate test scenarios for:
   - Happy path functionality
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Error conditions and validation
   - Performance requirements
   - Integration points

## Test Generation Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function/method behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Error Handling Tests**: Exception and validation scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Response time and load requirements

## Output Format
- Framework-specific test files (Jest, JUnit, pytest, etc.)
- Organized by feature/component
- Includes setup and teardown logic
- Contains descriptive test names and comments
- Links back to original specifications

## Quality Assurance
- Tests cover all acceptance criteria
- Tests validate both positive and negative scenarios
- Tests are maintainable and readable
- Tests follow project conventions
- Tests include appropriate assertions

## Usage in TDD Workflow
1. Use `/pm:issue-start` to load requirements
2. Run `/tdd:spec-to-test` to generate comprehensive tests
3. Execute `/tdd:red` to ensure tests fail appropriately
4. Continue with `/tdd:green` and `/tdd:refactor`

## Traceability Features
- Links tests to specific requirements
- Tags tests with GitHub Issue numbers
- Generates coverage reports mapping tests to specs
- Maintains bi-directional traceability
