# TDD Red Phase Command

Write failing tests first (Red phase of TDD cycle).

## Command
`/tdd:red`

## Description
Implements the Red phase of TDD by creating comprehensive failing tests based on requirements.

## Core Principle
**"Write failing tests before any implementation code"**

## Process
1. Analyze requirements/specifications
2. Identify all testable behaviors
3. Write focused, failing tests
4. Ensure tests fail for the right reasons
5. Verify test quality and coverage

## Test Quality Criteria
- Tests are specific and focused
- Tests fail for expected reasons
- Tests cover edge cases and error conditions
- Tests are readable and maintainable
- Tests follow project naming conventions

## Integration
- Links tests to CCPM specifications
- Updates issue progress with test coverage
- Tracks test creation metrics

## Next Step
After Red phase completion, use `/tdd:green` to implement the solution.
