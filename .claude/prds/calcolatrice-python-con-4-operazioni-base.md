# PRD: calcolatrice-python-con-4-operazioni-base

## Executive Summary

A simple, reliable Python calculator module that provides the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with proper error handling and input validation. This module will serve as a foundation for mathematical computations in Python applications and can be used both programmatically and via command-line interface.

## Problem Statement

Many Python developers need basic arithmetic functionality without importing heavy mathematical libraries. Current solutions either lack proper error handling, don't provide clean APIs, or are over-engineered for simple use cases. We need a lightweight, reliable calculator that handles edge cases gracefully and can be easily integrated into existing Python projects.

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Developer (Primary)**
- Needs reliable arithmetic operations in Python applications
- Wants clean, simple API without external dependencies
- Requires proper error handling for production use

**Student/Learner (Secondary)**
- Learning Python programming fundamentals
- Needs clear examples of function design and error handling
- Wants to understand basic arithmetic implementation

### Detailed User Journeys

**Developer Journey:**
1. Imports calculator module into Python project
2. Calls arithmetic functions with numeric parameters
3. Receives calculated results or clear error messages
4. Integrates seamlessly with existing codebase

**CLI User Journey:**
1. Runs calculator from command line
2. Enters mathematical expression
3. Receives immediate calculation result
4. Can perform multiple calculations in sequence

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Function: `add(a, b)` returns sum of two numbers
- Supports integers and floating-point numbers
- Returns numeric result

**FR-002: Subtraction Operation**
- Function: `subtract(a, b)` returns difference (a - b)
- Supports integers and floating-point numbers
- Returns numeric result

**FR-003: Multiplication Operation**
- Function: `multiply(a, b)` returns product of two numbers
